# Guessing game class-03

# Added a fourth variable to guess my son's age.
# 4th variable tells user if guess was too high or low.
# Stretch uses WHILE followed by if/else. 

# Added a counter to keep track of correct answers
# Counter is given a value of 0. Then, inside each IF statement, counter++ is used to keep track of only correct answers.

# Future fix for final counter alert: my alert says "questions" even if it should be singular. Should I use an if/else statement here?
